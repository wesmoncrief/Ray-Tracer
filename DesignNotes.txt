Implementation Plans

1) Create the objects, set up scene
2) Create local illumination
3) Create reflection rays & transparent rays


--- 1) ---


currently the 'pokeball problem'
now i noticed that specular term is showing up on the 'opposite' side that should have no lighting at all
- fixed both of these problems by allowing shape to 'occlude' itself, but moving the ray that goes
from the intersection point on the sphere to the light source one unit away from the object before
doing occlusion calculation
