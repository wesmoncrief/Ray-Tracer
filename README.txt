In my ray tracer, I have implemented all of the requirements. The first scene that is displayed should show all of the
required characteristics. It has a red light coming from the back of the display, a faint blue light coming from the
foreground, and a white light from the left middle (as evidenced by the more prominent shadows). It contains two
planes and four spheres. There is one sphere with a high level of reflectivity, and the others don't reflect.
They all have different colors and coefficients ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection.
Because some of the properties may not be very clear, I added several more images to look at.
You can cycle through these images by pressing any key.

Note that occasionally on my computer, a rendering results with one or more shapes being completely white.
If this occurs, just cycle through the images. It should appear correct the next time.
